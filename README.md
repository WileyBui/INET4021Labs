## Lab 1

This lab uses CGI and C programming language. 

The main goal of this lab is to create a HTTP web server based on RFC/1945. The server is built on C socket programming and abstraction learned so far in INET 4021 - Network Programming.

Additionally, the server should be efficient in regards to speed and resource allocation.
